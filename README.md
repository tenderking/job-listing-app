# A Job Listings App
## This is our take on the frontend-mentor challenge

The challenge is to build out this job listing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

We could can use any tools we liked to help you complete the challenge. We chose to use quasar. A nodejs frame that's builds on top of the vuejs framework.



## Install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```
npx quasar dev
```

### Lint the files
```
npx run lint
```

### Build the app for production
```
npx quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
